    <p>Hi Hiveans, welcome to another travel blog! My friends and I embarked on a long weekend adventure in the Western Visayas region namely in Panay and Antique. PS. It is not my first time being in this region but I loved the place so I decided to go back and tag along with my friends. </p>

        The province of Antique in Western Visayas has a lot to offer for intrepid travelers. With all its natural attractions, the province is really best enjoyed outdoors. Don’t expect to be holing up in luxury hotels with high-speed WiFi during your stay. Most of the accommodation options remain rustic and not suited for finicky travelers. Take the opportunity to slow down and enjoy the simple life away from urban comforts, reconnect with nature and spend quality time with family or friends.</p>
